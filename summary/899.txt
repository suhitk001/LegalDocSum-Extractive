Appeal No. 167 of 1955.
section N. Kherdekar, N. K. Kherdekar and A. G. Ratna.
Both the trial court and the District Judge held that respondent Sridhar was entitled to preempt and determined the fair consideration to be Rs. 3,306.
(3) (1921) 48 I.A. 475.
Under section 184 the right also arises in the case of an exchange.
It was held by the Privy Council in Immudipattam Thirugnana section O. Kondema Naik vs Peria Dorasami (3) which was a case of a zamindari estate that it could not be transferred except by a registered instrument.
But it was argued for the respondents that the Privy Council had not only approved the observation of Sir John Edge, C. J., in Begum vs Mohammad Yakub(1) but has also approved the view of the Calcutta High Court in Jadu Lal Sahu vs Janki Koer (2).
In our opinion the judgment of the High Court was erroneous and we would therefore allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and dismiss the suit with costs throughout.
